A Stopwatch App is a digital tool designed to measure time intervals, allowing users to track elapsed time with precision. It typically provides a start, stop, and reset function, along with the ability to track lap times or split times for more advanced usage. Stopwatch apps are useful for a variety of scenarios, such as sports, cooking, studying, fitness, and any situation where time tracking is essential.

Key Features of the Stopwatch App:
Start, Pause, and Reset Functionality:

The core feature of a stopwatch app is its ability to start, pause, and reset the timer.
Start: Begins tracking the elapsed time from zero.
Pause: Pauses the timer, freezing the current elapsed time.
Reset: Resets the timer back to zero or the initial starting time.
Lap and Split Time Tracking (Optional):

A lap or split time feature allows users to track multiple intervals within a single session. Each lap time records the time taken for a specific segment, which can be useful for tracking progress in activities like running or exercise routines.
Lap Time: Records the time for a single lap or segment, and then continues counting without resetting the total time.
Split Time: Displays intermediate results, usually without stopping the timer, to show different segments or phases of an activity.
